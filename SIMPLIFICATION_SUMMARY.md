# Codebase Simplification Summary

## Overview
The codebase has been simplified to improve stability, performance, and maintainability by removing unnecessary complexity.

## Key Changes

### 1. Export Process Simplification
- **Removed**: Complex progress simulation with varying speeds and intervals
- **Added**: Simple linear progress (0-100%)
- **Benefit**: More predictable and stable export experience

### 2. Fixed Export Quality
- **Removed**: Quality selection (720p/1080p/4K)
- **Fixed**: Always uses "balanced" quality (720p)
- **Benefit**: Consistent performance and file sizes

### 3. Simplified Preview
- **Removed**: Complex video switching based on audio beats during playback
- **Added**: Simple preview showing the first video
- **Benefit**: Smoother playback without video switching glitches

### 4. UI Cleanup
- **Removed**: Settings button and panel
- **Removed**: Export quality dropdown
- **Benefit**: Cleaner interface with fewer options to confuse users

### 5. Code Improvements
- **Removed**: ~176 lines of complex code
- **Simplified**: Progress tracking logic
- **Simplified**: FFmpeg processing calls
- **Benefit**: Easier to maintain and debug

## Performance Impact
- Faster UI responsiveness (less state updates)
- More predictable export times
- Reduced chance of timing-related bugs
- Better mobile performance

## User Experience
- Simpler workflow
- Fewer decisions to make
- More reliable exports
- Consistent quality output

## Technical Details
- Progress updates are now linear (0.05 → 0.20 → 0.30 → 0.90 → 1.0)
- Always uses FFmpeg preset "fast" with CRF 21 at 720p
- Preview shows first uploaded video continuously
- No complex beat-synced video switching

## Future Considerations
If advanced features are needed in the future:
1. Add them as optional/advanced settings
2. Keep the default experience simple
3. Test thoroughly before adding complexity
4. Consider performance impact on mobile devices
